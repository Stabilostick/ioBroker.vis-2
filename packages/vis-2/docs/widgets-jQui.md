# jQui widgets - jQuery UI widgets
This is a collection of widgets in material style.

Originally the jQuery UI Framework was used for the styled widgets in vis-1, but now it was replaced by Material style (React JS MUI Framework).

The name because of compatibility reasons is still jQui.

The Idea of the developer in 2014 was for every variation of a widget to create a new widget type. This is not the case anymore. Now the widgets are more configurable.
